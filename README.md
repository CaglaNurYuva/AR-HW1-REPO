Unity Editor Version: 6000.0.24f1

PS - 1: Android build could not be created due to some errors related to Gradle build tool. I tried for days to solve the error but I could not solve it. Therefore, I tested the project with my computer's camera, not a phone.


PS - 2: The files given below are not put in the GitHub repository due to their large sizes. You need to manually download and upload Vuforia package in your own Unity environment. 

/Packages/com.ptc.vuforia.engine-10.27.3.tgz
/Library/Bee/artifacts/Android/d8kzr/libil2cpp.so
/Library/Bee/artifacts/Android/il2cppOutput/build/arm64-v8a/libil2cpp.dbg.so

PS - 3: All tasks given in the PDF document are done. However, "Display at least three steps involving the (user) selection of a virtual object." could not be tested since I could not get Android build, I tried to solve the error for days, with different computers and versions etc. But it did not work out.


PS - 4: Explanation of the scene's behaviour that could not be shown on the video: 3 virtual cube are shown. 
-> When I touch on the smallest cube on touch screen with my finger, It changes its color and If I click on it again, it goes back to its past color (toggling color behaviour).
-> When I touch on the smallest cube on touch screen with my finger, it moves forward. 
-> When I touch on the smallest cube on touch screen with my finger, it detonates with bombing animation and the cube object is destroyed.
